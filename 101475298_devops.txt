DevOps, a compound of development (Dev) and operations (Ops), emphasizes a culture of collaboration and communication
between software developers and IT professionals, streamlining the process of software delivery and infrastructure
changes.

It incorporates automation and monitoring at all stages of software construction, from integration, testing, releasing
to deployment, and infrastructure management, aiming for faster development cycles, increased deployment frequency,
and more dependable releases in close alignment with business objectives.

DevOps practices, such as continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD), enable teams to automate parts of
the software development process, reducing manual work, minimizing errors, and increasing efficiency.

By fostering a culture of continuous learning and improvement, DevOps encourages teams to experiment, learn from
failures, and continuously improve products and processes, thereby enhancing product quality and customer
satisfaction.
