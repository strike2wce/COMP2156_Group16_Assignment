Learning DevOps engineering is crucial in the software development cycle as it bridges the gap between software
development and IT operations, enabling faster and more efficient delivery of applications and services.

By mastering DevOps practices, individuals gain the ability to automate and streamline the software development
process, from coding and deployment to maintenance and updates, which significantly reduces the time-to-market for new
features and fixes.

DevOps engineers play a vital role in implementing continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines,
ensuring that code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for release to production, which enhances
software quality and reliability.
